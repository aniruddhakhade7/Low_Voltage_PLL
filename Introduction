For low power applications, PLL design becomes challenging task because of lower suppl voltage. As supply voltage
scales down, supply voltage noise also needs to be considered
while designing any block. There are many factor contributing
to supply voltage noise. One simple technique is to place
large capacitor between supply and ground. This requires
sufficiently larger area.
